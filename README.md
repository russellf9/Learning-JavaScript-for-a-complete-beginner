# Learning JavaScript for a complete beginner

## Motivation

This is an attempt to make a list relevant for a young secondary school student. 

In my opinion JavaScript is the best choice for a first programming language for a student to learn. This is because JavaScript has all the core programming features that a student would want to learn, with the ability to present the result visually within a web page.


## Learning resources with links

It's frustrating that links seem always to be paid courses!

## Use Github pages?

Hosting is a right pain, it is possible to use Github pages for free. Would take a little set up time though. Also, using [Github](https://codesandbox.io/) is great way to keep code projects.
